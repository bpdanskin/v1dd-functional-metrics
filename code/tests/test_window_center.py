"""The windowed-grating aperture centre: extraction, and imputation from the column.

Two of the 25 sessions record no aperture centre. `probe_window_center.py` established
that the `center_azimuth` / `center_elevation` columns are absent from those sessions'
stimulus tables entirely, so filling from the rest of the cortical column fills a real
absence rather than hiding a defect of ours.

Three things are worth asserting and one of them is easy to get wrong:

1. `window_center` reads the centre from **non-blank rows only**, because that is what
   `drifting_gratings_metrics` reads. A value present only on blank sweeps must read as
   absent, or a bug of ours would look like missing data — which is exactly the mistake
   the probe made before it was corrected.
2. The fill is the **median** of the column's donors. Column 2 / volume 2 sits 0.2 degrees
   off the rest of its column, so equality is the wrong test and the median is the right
   fill.
3. **`impute_dgw_center` must be shown to do something.** `pref_cond_fillna` was declared
   and documented from the start and never read, so flipping it was a silent no-op; the
   rule that came out of that is that a flag needs a test exercising both settings and
   asserting they differ. Section [5] is that test.
