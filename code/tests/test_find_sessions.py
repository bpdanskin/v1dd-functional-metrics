"""Session discovery across both NWB storage formats.

The first bug fixed here: globbing only `*/*.nwb.zarr` silently drops sessions stored as
plain HDF5 `.nwb`, and the symptom is a shorter session list rather than an error.

The second (2026-09-03): the per-format `or` fallbacks meant that on an asset which is
uniformly ONE format, the other format's shallow glob was legitimately empty, its `or`
fired, and `rglob` crawled every Zarr chunk tree — so `find_sessions` never returned at
all. **Every fixture in this file was mixed-format, so none of them could trigger it**,
and the fixtures' Zarr "stores" are empty directories, so descending into one cost nothing
here and was fatal on a real asset. Sections [8] and [9] cover both of those shapes.
